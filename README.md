The scholarly debate on international migration has been characterized over the past 30 years by a focus on globalization and a paradigm shift to the study of migration management. The key actors in migration management are the nation states and also the international meetings and organisations consisting of trained experts. They have become more and more the subject of current discourses around the legitimacy of technocratic governance. In this article we will historicize the concept of migration management and investigate the connections between technocratic experts and one of todayâ€™s biggest players in the international field, albeit a fairly contested one: the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) by operationalizing the concept of discourses coalitions.
